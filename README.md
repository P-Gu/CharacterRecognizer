# CharacterRecognizer

The project gets input from a camera and outputs on a screen. Other input and output requirements are fulfilled by the group project at the first half of semester.
"faces" folder contains a small part of Danbooru anime image dataset, and it is currently the training and testing data. cs345.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file I run on MicroSoft Azure that trains the AlexNet CNN model and predicts labels for real-world photos of anime characters. More details about training are in the word file on Piazza.
