# CharacterRecognizer

"faces" folder contains a small part of Danbooru anime image dataset, and it is currently the training and testing data. cs345.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file I run on MicroSoft Azure that trains the AlexNet CNN model. I'm currently experimenting on different batch sizes, learning rate, and epochs. Right now 0.01 learning rate with batch size 64 gives training set accuracy of after 1000 epochs for differentiating between 7 labels.
